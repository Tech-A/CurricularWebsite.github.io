# Extracurricular Website

## Project Overview 
This is a small website I made showcasing the extracurricular activities offered at my high school. The aim of this project was to help students explore and engage with the extracurricular opportunities available at the school. It provides students with easy access to information about various clubs, sports, and activities they can join with descriptions and contact information for each activity.

### Key Features
- Organized pages for different categories of extracurricular activities with key information and links.
- A fun quiz to help students discover which extracurriculars they might enjoy.
- (Not working anymore) A database that tracked students and the extracurriculars they joined.

### Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Database: Firebase
